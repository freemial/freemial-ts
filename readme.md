# The Freemial Project

In July 2025 Vorwerk discontinued the Temial tea machine, and shut down the connected services making it's app operational. The Freemial Project aims to recreate that functionality.

Consists of 3 components:
* CLI: Connects to the Temial, configures it to use a Freemial server instead of the now defunkt vorkerk server.
* Websocket Server: Accepts connections from the Temial
* Connect library: Used by the CLI, a programmatic module that allows developers to do the same

## How does this work?
